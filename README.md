## Next-step/Reflections 
It was my first time using Go and honestly not too sure if I fully grasp it (pointersðŸ«¥). The same goes for docker and redis but I felt this project gave me a good introduction. I also deployed the backend through GCP (google cloud run + VCP + redis) was super overwhelming at first and maybe still is.
